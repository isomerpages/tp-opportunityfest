- ##### **Your skills are valued and varied!** If you are conflicted to switch to do something which is different from your course of study, remember that a diploma equips you sufficiently for the work force. Leverage on your transferable skills to gain work experience which can help affirm your interest and build new skills.  

 - ##### **Set SMART goals,** be focused and remain productive to keep pace with peers. If you are considering a gap year, be sure that it is goal driven, with a plan to engage in purposeful activities in a defined timeline.

- ##### If you are **unclear about your career interest,** keep in mind that interest can be discovered with exposure to different experiences. Take the first step to try out new things - this first step could be a crucial stepping stone to bring you closer to your career aspiration. Re-assess your career interests, skills confidence and work values on [MySkillsFuture portal](https://www.myskillsfuture.gov.sg/content/portal/en/assessment/landing.html).

- ##### **Be open to seize opportunities,** whether they are full-time jobs, freelance jobs or work-study options.  They allow you to build up valuable experiences and skills. You may even receive on-the-job or formal training (e.g. with work-study programmes) which will develop your skills even more.   Not sure if an opportunity suits you?  Give it a try and you may discover that it is a great fit and an opportunity to gain experience and skills for future roles.
